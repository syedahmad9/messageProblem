# Message Problem
This project is demonstration of resolving problem using Design Patterns.

Our challenge was to Broadcast messages using different communication channels like Email, SMS, Push Notification

Implementation is very basic. Can be imroved on request. 

I have used Facade and Dependency Injection Pattern to resolve this problem.

Facade Patter is used to simplify complexity of the system and provide simple interface to consume by client.

Dependency injection to decouple modules and able to make more testable program.
